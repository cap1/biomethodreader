Using electroamgenetic waves like, Light or X-Ray to
get an image of biologic things.

\subsection{Microscopy}

\subsubsection*{Fluorescence}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Use certain wavelengths to excite something in the probe,
			than filter out the this wavelength to see the reaction in the probe.
	\item Can be used in Combination with GFP
	\item Code for the GFP is added to the Protein in research, Hybridization
	\item ``Fluorescene-In-Situ-Hybridization'' (FISH)
	\item Confocal Micorscopy emits light on a small spot of the probe,
			and scans the whole object
	\item \textrightarrow 2-Photon-Microscopy, even smaller spots
	\item STED - Stimulated Emission Depletion
	\item \textrightarrow A Second laser depletes the signals from the
		periphery of the the focal point, thereby enhancing sharpness
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{X-Ray}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Wavelength
	\item Problems: Focusing Lenses difficult to build and needs a powerful, dangerous X-Ray source
\end{itemize}
